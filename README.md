# Python Snake
This is the classic Snake game recreated in Python. The goal is to eat food to grow your tail. Try to obtain the highest score you can! But be careful, if you run into yourself--or a wall--it's game over!

## Usage
Run ```py main.py``` from the root directory. This project requires <a href=https://www.pygame.org/>Pygame</a> to be installed in order for it to run. Use WASD to move the snake's head. If you lose, you can press space to restart the game. Press ESC to quit.

## Project Details
This project was done in November 2018. It uses Pygame as a simple graphics library. This was one of my first times using Python, and it taught me how to install and use external libraries as well as the basics of objet-oriented programming in Python.

## Future Work
This project is meant to be fairly simple and was just used as a learning experience for Python. But, some potential expansions could include allowing the snake to move off one side and come back on the other, and for the high score to be saved between instances.
